# PetitTubeBot
A Discord bot integration of the petittube.com website, which gives you random YouTube videos with no views. You can try it out [here](https://discord.gg/72rUN6vqKs)!
## Usage
Super simple. In any channel the bot is in, just @mention the bot and it will reply with a YouTube link.
## Set it up yourself
If you want to run the bot yourself or you want to help develop it, you can download and unzip or clone this repository to a folder. In this folder create `token.txt` and save your Discord bot token into it. Make sure you have node.js installed on your system, then open a command shell in that folder and run `npm i` to install the required packages. Then you can run `node .` to start the bot.
